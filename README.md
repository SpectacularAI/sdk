# Spectacular AI SDK

**Spectacular AI SDK** fuses data from cameras and IMU sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope)
and outputs an accurate 6-degree-of-freedom pose of a device.
The SDK also includes a _Mapping API_ that can be used to access the full SLAM map for
both real-time and offline 3D reconstruction use cases.

This repository contains the public parts of the SDK source code, in particular, command line tooling.
